## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. My main motivation was prepare for Coding Bootcamp. 
To build key skill and learning tenative skills for future projects.
Found ways to fix broken code or apply key code to make a page function properly. I learned thing already knew like HTML, CSS and my lack of knowledge in Javascript. However, I was able to use commands to create and develop this project via VS code, Git Bash and etc.
